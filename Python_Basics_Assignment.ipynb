        "1. What is Python, and why is it popular?\n",
        "- Python is a high-level, interpreted programming language known for its clear syntax and readability. Its popularity stems from several factors:\n",
        "\n",
        "  - Its syntax is clean and easy to learn, which makes it accessible for beginners.\n",
        "\n",
        "  - It's used in a wide range of applications, including web development, data science, artificial intelligence, automation, and scientific computing.\n",
        "\n",
        "  - Python has a vast collection of pre-built libraries and frameworks (like NumPy, Pandas, Django, and TensorFlow) that simplify complex tasks.\n",
        "\n",
        "  - A large and active global community provides excellent support, documentation, and tutorials.\n",
        "  \n",
        "2. What is an interpreter in Python?\n",
        "- In Python, an interpreter is a program that reads and executes code line by line. Unlike compilers that translate the entire program into machine code before running it, the interpreter translates and runs the code one instruction at a time. This makes the development process faster and more interactive, as you can see the results of your code immediately.\n",
        "\n",
        "3. What are pre-defined keywords in Python?\n",
        "- Keywords are reserved words in Python that have special meanings and purposes.\n",
        "- They are part of the language's syntax and cannot be used for anything else, such as variable names or function names.\n",
        "- Examples include if, for, while, def, class, True, False, and None.\n",
        "\n",
        "4. Can keywords be used as variable names?\n",
        "- No, keywords cannot be used as variable names. Since they are reserved for specific functions within the language, using them as identifiers would create ambiguity and result in a syntax error.\n",
        "\n",
        "5. What is mutability in Python?\n",
        "- Mutability refers to the ability of an object to be changed after it has been created.\n",
        "\n",
        "  - Mutable objects can be modified. For example, you can add, remove, or change elements in a list.\n",
        "\n",
        "  - Immutable objects cannot be changed. If you need to alter an immutable object, you must create a new one. Examples include integers, strings, and tuples.\n",
        "\n",
        "6. Why are lists mutable, but tuples are immutable?\n",
        "- The distinction between lists and tuples is a fundamental design choice in Python.\n",
        "\n",
        "  - Lists are designed to be dynamic, ordered collections whose contents are expected to change frequently. Their mutability allows for efficient addition, removal, and modification of elements.\n",
        "\n",
        "  - Tuples are designed to be fixed, ordered collections. Their immutability makes them reliable for use as dictionary keys or in sets, where the elements must be unchangeable (hashable). It also provides a degree of data integrity, ensuring that the collection of items remains constant.\n",
        "\n",
        "7. What is the difference between “==” and “is” operators in Python?\n",
        "\n",
        "- The == and is operators are used for comparison but check for different things:\n",
        "\n",
        " - == (Equality): This operator compares the values of two objects to see if they are equal.\n",

        "  - not: Reverses the logical state, turning True into False and False into True.\n",
        "\n",
        "9. What is type casting in Python?\n",
        "- Type casting (or type conversion) is the process of converting a variable from one data type to another. This is often necessary when you need to perform operations on variables of different types. For example, you might cast a string containing a number, like \"10\", into an integer, 10, to perform mathematical calculations. Common type casting functions include int(), float(), str(), and list().\n",

        "10. What is the difference between implicit and explicit type casting?\n",
        "- *Implicit Type Casting* : This is an automatic conversion performed by the Python interpreter without any user intervention. It usually happens when you mix data types in an operation, such as adding an integer and a float. Python will automatically convert the \"lower\" data type (integer) to the \"higher\" data type (float) to prevent data loss."

        "- The purpose of conditional statements (like if, elif, and else) is to control the flow of a program by allowing it to make decisions. They enable a program to execute specific blocks of code only if certain conditions are met, leading to different outcomes based on different inputs or states.\n",
        "\n",
        "12. How does the elif statement work?\n",
        "- The elif (short for \"else if\") statement is used to check for multiple conditions in sequence. It follows an if statement and is only evaluated if the preceding if (and any other elif before it) is False. If the elif condition is True, its code block is executed, and the program skips any remaining elif or else blocks in the chain.\n",

        "- The primary difference lies in how they control their iteration:\n",
        "\n",
        "  - for loop: A for loop is used for iterating over a sequence (like a list, tuple, dictionary, set, or string) or other iterable objects. It runs for a pre-defined number of times based on the length of the sequence. It's often called a definite loop.\n",
        "\n",
        "  - while loop: A while loop repeatedly executes a block of code as long as a specified condition is True. It's used when you don't know the exact number of iterations in advance. It's considered an indefinite loop.\n",
        "\n",
        "14. Describe a scenario where a while loop is more suitable than a for loop.\n",
        "- A while loop is more suitable in situations where the number of iterations is not known beforehand and depends on a condition that could change during execution.\n",
        "\n",
